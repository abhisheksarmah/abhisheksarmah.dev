> This Unique School in Guwahati Accepts Plastic As Fees, Teaches Students how to run a business, how to earn a living, how to start development work in their community and the best part, how to maintain their environment

Recently I came to know about the Akshar school, which is situated in the picturesque Pamohi of Guwahati. It was started by the lovely couples [Mazin Mukhtar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mazin-mukhtar-587a1010b/) and [Parmita Sarma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parmita-sarma-akshar/).

Every day thousands of tons of plastics are used throughout the whole country. And many of the times, the plastic waste’s are burnt in various parts of the country, which pollutes our environment. And the Akshar Foundation is taking a great step towards minimising the plastic waste’s and recycling the waste to produce something useful for the environment.

Students are asked to go for a collection of plastic waste from different restaurants and households near the school vicinity and dump it in their collection centre to make Eco-bricks. The students segregate the wastes into a single plastic bottle to make a sturdy Eco-brick. The Eco-bricks are later used for various construction purposes in the school. So, in one hour how much they can do according to that they get a minimum wage which is a student salary and which is directly deposited into the individual’s bank account.

In our country, small kids are excluded from elementary education due to poverty. But, Akshar is doing an exception, they are helping the kids providing student salary, who works on making Echo-bricks. This helps the poor kids to have a sustainable livelihood as well as move forward with their education.

Akshar also became unique with its curriculum that combines conventional academics with vocational training, job training and business training. They want each student to know how to run a business, how to earn a living, how to start development work in their community and how to maintain their environment. This is the best part I loved about Akshar.

By watching a video of only five minutes, I was very much satisfied with their vision of helping students to build their career journey from the beginning of their school life. They are forwarding the education system to the next level.

Growing up with the conventional education system that all are following, sometimes I get frustrated about the future of these small kids. As later in their journey they need the extracurricular activity once in a while in their career, only the mark is not enough for one to become successful in life.

As I can see, nowadays the schools are competing against each other by hiking tuition fees, comparing the students with their grades, burdening the small kids with dozens of books, making the students more concerned about their marks, homework etc. but the Akshar Forum found to be an exception.

The magnificent nature around the school cannot make me wait long to visit this unique School. The next I visit Guwahati, I will check this place out.

In the end, I want to make a point that our education system should at least co-operate with Akshar for making Indian Education System a to a higher standard around the globe.

Hope, this article helps to play a small influence on our future kids.

Have a great day. Signing off for today :sleeping:
