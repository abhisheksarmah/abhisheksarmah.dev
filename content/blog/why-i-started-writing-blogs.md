I always hated of writing things down. But working as software developer, I read many blog posts of others about any technical ground. 

But it cames to a point where it might not always be helpful through reading others articles. You might get a different way of getting the things done. You could write your own implementation of the work which is already available. There are no hard and fast rule that you can not write about which is already available in the internet.

Writing gives you more power of learning the topics better. So, I started to write about the technical difficulities, setup or any best articles I found out during my development phase. I also believe that somone will get benefitted by my writing. By writing I could also sharpen up my writing skills. 

My english is not so good, I am trying hard to improve it but I might be wrong somewhere because of grammar. Any suggestion which will help me, writing better.
