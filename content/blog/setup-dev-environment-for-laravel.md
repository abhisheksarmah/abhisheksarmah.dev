I am having a older lenovo machine with configuration (AMD A6, 4 gb RAM) :rofl: . I wanted to set it up as backup machine along side with my Macbook Pro (late 2012 model). Actually I wanted to check out how extreme configurations my machine could handle.

At first I tried out installing ubuntu as my OS, but it seems to consume more RAM than I thought. After talking with my buddy mithicher, he referred me to install light weight version of linux kernel named Linux Mint. After setting my machine with laravel and vuejs dev environments, I am able to work smoothly. 

Somtimes it lags for a moment, but it's not a matter of concern. Since, it is going to save me on my hardtimes when my Pro needs a repaire work. By the end of this year, I am planning to buy a machine with good configuration (obviously Mac) :thumbsup:.
