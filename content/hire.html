       	As a developer I value well written code, that's easy to read, and isn't unnecessarily complex. I don't see automated testing as optional, but rather a key part of writing good code. I appreciate following industry set coding standards. I make a point of continually learning and improving through attending online conferences, reading books and blogs, watching screencasts, and following industry experts.
